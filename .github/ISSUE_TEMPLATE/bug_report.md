This repository is for Apple Music Elctron. 

This app will be sunseted very soon and we are NOT maintaining this app
unless of a security issue. We encourage you to try Cider, our new music app built from scratch. Issues filled on that repository will be seen and will be acted upon.

As a reminder, this is **not** Cider. Please don't file issues for Cider here.

Cider can be found here -> https://github.com/ciderapp/Cider
